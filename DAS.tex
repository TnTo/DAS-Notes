\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Aims}
The aim of this model is to highlight the macroeconomic and distributional effects of some welfare policies.  
The focus is put in particular on some (recent) policies yet unapplied in real world as Universal Basic Income, Job Guarantee schemes or the presence of only cooperative firms.

\section{General Hypothesis}
\subsection{Time}
The simulation's time-span has to be long enough to observe the effects of introducing a policy. But, it is unreasonable to prolong the simulation over 5-10 years after the policy's introduction because, in any real world context, a government is able to tune or revert the policy afterwards.

Choosing a time-frame of 7 to 15 years (with the policy's introduction after 2 to 5 years), allows simulating the model with a higher frequency to smooth out behaviours: considering 12 months per year and 4 weeks per month, simulating at week-scale require 48 ticks per year, and so 336 to 720 ticks (or alternatively 84 to 180 using monthly time-scale).

\subsection{Close Economy}
The assumption of a close economy strongly reduce the complexity of the model, but prevent to observe some economic phenomena like an export-led growth (such as Italy or Germany) or the offshoring labour-intensive productions.
Nevertheless, this is a common hypothesis which is used also in this model.

\begin{enh}[Multi-Country Model]
	A compromise for a future development is to model in a AB-SFC setting the main economy of the model while keeping aggregated (SFC only) the other economies.
\end{enh}

\subsection{Sectors}
The core sector of most SFC models \parencite{nikiforos2017} and a "Financial Intermediaries" sector are included.

The list is: Households ($\mathcal{H}$), Capital Goods Firms ($\mathcal{F}_K$), Consumption Goods Firms ($\mathcal{F}_C$), Financial Intermediaries ($\mathcal{I}$), Banks ($\mathcal{B}$), Government ($\mathcal{G}$), Central Bank ($\mathcal{C}$).
	
\subsection{Real Assets}
The model comprises three kind of real assets: Capital Goods ($K$) and Consumption Goods ($C$), each divided in two kinds, Essential Goods ($F$) and Luxury Goods ($L$).

\subsection{Financial Assets}
The model includes seven different financial assets. 
Bank Deposits ($D$) of Households, Firms and Financial Intermediaries. 
Banks Reserves and Government Account at the Central Bank ($A$), which are not interest-bearing. 
Central Bank Advances ($A$) to Banks.
Loans ($L$) issued by the Banks to Households and Firms. Government's Bonds ($B$) hold by Banks, Central Bank and Financial Intermediaries. 
Firms' and Banks' Equities ($E^\mathcal{F}$, $E^\mathcal{B}$) held by Financial Intermediaries.
Financial Intermediaries' Shares ($S$) held by Households.

\section{Sectors}
\subsection{Households}

\subsection{Firms}

\subsection{Financial Intermediaries}
The role of Financial Intermediares in the model is only to decouple the decision, made by the Households, on the amount to be financially invested and the actual choice of investment.

\subsection{Banks}

\subsection{Government}

\subsection{Central Bank}
In the model the role of Central Bank is to fix the Government's Bonds interest rate $r_B$ and the Advances interest rate $r_A$.

Additionally, it passively buys and sells Government's Bonds on request and guarantees all the Advances needed by banks.

In other words, the Central Bank is a lender of last resort for the Government, which then has no accounting limits to spending, and prevent any speculative attacks on debt.

\section{Real Assets}
\subsection{Essential Goods}
The exact definition of essential good (and service) it is not easy to be give. An intuition can be provided by the Foundational Economy approach \parencite{arcidiacono2018a}: \begin{quote}
	The sphere of the foundational was then demarcated by three criteria: these goods and services were necessary to everyday life; were consumed daily by all citizens regardless of income; and were distributed according to population through branches and networks. They were partly non-market, generally sheltered and one way or another politically franchised.
\end{quote}

Operationally, we can image the essential goods in the model as the ones included in the basket used by national statistics offices to determinate the poverty line. In this sense, it is a set of goods which continuously mutate to adapt to new life needs.

\begin{enh}[Housing]
	Among essential goods one should require ad hoc modelling: houses. Houses are special for three reasons.
	
	First, they are very heterogeneous in prices and quality, and both are strongly related to the position. In other words, including houses requires (quite always) to make the model spatially explicit.
	
	Second, the expenses for housing, in form of rent or mortgage, account for a significant part of monthly consumptions for poor individuals (up to one half).
	
	Third, real estate properties are an important form of rent extraction and an important tool of investment, and so another important channel of redistribution.
\end{enh}

\subsection{Luxury Goods}
Luxury goods are, by exclusion, all the non-essential goods.

\begin{enh}[Diversified Goods]
	A subsequent version of the model can include different (abstract) goods to be produced and consumed. This will  create two different innovation processes (better technology for existing goods, or technology for new goods) and will account for the empirical fact that higher the income more diversified the consumptions are \parencite[cfr.][ยง2]{didomenico2022}.
\end{enh}

\subsection{Capital Goods}

\section{Financial Assets}

\subsection{Advances}

\subsection{Loans}

\subsection{Bonds}
Bonds are sold and bought at their nominal value and last a single period. Bonds hold by Central Bank are automatically renewed.

\subsection{Equities}

\subsection{Shares}
Financial Intermediaries' Shares are unlimited in number and re-bought by the Financial Intermediaries at their nominal value on request.
